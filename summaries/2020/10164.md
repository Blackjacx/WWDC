Presenters: _Wil Addario-Turner_

- Tests can pass or fail, or with `XCTSkip`, be marked with an explicit "skip" result.
- In Xcode 11.4, `XCTSkip`, `XCTSkipIf` and `XCTSkipUnless` were introduced to allow skipping tests at runtime.
- Call `throw XCTSkip("message")` and the test will be skipped.
- `XCTSkipIf` skips when the expression is true. `XCTSkipUnless` skips when the expression is false.
- Check the results from the test navigator and the test report with the line where the skip occurred, along with a reason explaining why.
